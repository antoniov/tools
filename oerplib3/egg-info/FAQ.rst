**Why this module was forked from OERPlib?**

OERPlib runs just with python2 and the author did not migrate
package on python3

**Why I should use this module? Was it better to use OdooRPC?**

OdooRPC runs on python3 but it does not support Odoo xmlrpc protocol.
So, if you have to read data from an old Odoo version database, you have to
use OERPlib3.
