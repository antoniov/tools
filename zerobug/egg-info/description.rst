ZeroincombenzeÂ® continuous testing framework for python and bash programs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library can run unit test of target package software.
Supported languages are *python* (through z0testlib.py)
and *bash* (through z0testrc)

*zerobug* supports test automation, aggregation of tests into collections
and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.
The *zerobug* module provides all code that make it easy to support testing
both for python programs both for bash scripts.
*zerobug* differs from pytest standard library because show execution test with
a message like "n/tot message" where *n* is current unit test and *tot* is the
total unit test to execute, that is a sort of advancing test progress.

*zerobug* is built on follow concepts:

* test main - it is a main program to executes all test runners
* test runner - it is a program to executes one or more test suites
* test suite - it is a collection of test cases
* test case -it is a smallest unit test

Test main file (usually is called 'all_tests') execute the test suite declared
in source file. If no test list declared, it searches for test runner files
named 'test_[0-9]*' executed in sorted order.
This behavior differs slightly from pytest standard library.

Test suite is a collection of test case named 'test_[0-9]*'
executed in sorted order. Also this behavior differs from
pytest standard library.

Because *zerobug* can show total number of unit test to execute, it run tests
in 2 passes. In the first pass it counts test, in second pass executes really
it.

Every unit test file may be called with follows switches:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b, --debug           run tests in debug mode
  -e, --echo            enable echoing even if not interactive tty
  -J                    load travisrc
  -k, --keep            keep current logfile
  -l file, --logname file
                        set logfile name
  -N, --new             create new logfile
  -n, --dry-run         count and display # unit tests
  -O                    load odoorc
  -q, --quiet           run tests without output (quiet mode)
  -r number, --restart number
                        set to counted tests, 1st one next to this
  -s number, --start number
                        set to counted tests, 1st one next to this
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -v, --verbose         verbose mode
  -x, --qsanity         like -X but run silently
  -X, --esanity         execute test library sanity check and exit
  -z number, --end number
                        display total # tests when execute them
  -0, --no-count        no count # unit tests
  -1, --coverage        run tests for coverage
  -3, --python3         use python3

  (w/o switches) do run test and return test result


Package, test environment and deployment are:

    ./                  Package directory
                        inside python test program is self.pkg_dir
                        inside bash test script is $RUNDIR
    ./tests             Unit test directory
                        should contains one of 'all_tests' or 'test_PKGNAME'
                        inside python test program is self.test_dir
                        inside bash test script is $TESTDIR
    ./tests/z0testlib   Python file unit test library from zerobug package
                        may be not present if zerobug python package installed
    ./tests/z0testrc    Bash file unit test library from zerobug package
                        may be not present if zerobug python package installed
                        inside bash test script is $Z0TLIBDIR
    ./tests/z0librc     Local bash script library for bash scripts;
                        Could be in user root directory or in /etc directory
                        inside bash test script is $Z0LIBDIR
    ./_travis           Interface to travis emulator if present (obsolete);
                        it used in local host to emulate some travis functions
                        inside bash test script is $TRAVISDIR

Unit test can run in package directory or in ./tests directory of package.


Every test can inquire internal context.

    this_fqn      parent caller full qualified name (i.e. /opt/odoo/z0bug.pyc)
    this          parent name, w/o extension (i.e. z0bug)

    min_test      # of test executed before this one                       "-r"
    on_error      behavior after error, 'continue' or 'raise' (default)

Environment read:
